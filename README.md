I started coding at 13 with Python, building a Morse code dictionary for fun. At 16, I built my first commercial project—an AI chatbot that replaced a company's lengthy application form by extracting information through conversation. That experience showed me how code can eliminate friction. Since then, I've been building systems that simplify complexity: I created oDoc.app, an open-source freelance platform with zero-fee crypto payments and won a $35k grant from DFINITY. Then I built Weekaly.com, an AI scheduling assistant that's 10x faster than traditional tools. Today, I specialize in blockchain applications on ICP and Solana, and conversational AI—still driven by that same goal of making technology invisible to users.
