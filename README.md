Started coding at 13 with Python. At 16, I built my first commercial AI chatbot that 
replaced a lengthy form system—it taught me that the best code eliminates friction.

Today, I architect Web3 systems and conversational AI that make complex technology feel 
simple. The revolutionary potential of blockchain—replacing entire financial 
infrastructures with smart contracts—drives my work in decentralized platforms.
